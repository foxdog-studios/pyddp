__Warning__

This library is still in the planning stage. If you use
it, please use a specific version, e.g.., in your ``requirements.txt`` add the
line;

```
pyddp==0.3.1
```

I (well, Foxdog Studios) improve this library on an as-needed basis. That is,
I add something when we (Foxdog Studios) require it. If you'd like a feature,
create an issue. The advantage of this is that we use every feature (in our
stage show) and so it gets tested regularly. I've kept the API very thin, the
feature you want might already be supported and I'll just expose it nicely.


__Connect to a Meteor DDP server__

  ```Python
  # Import the DDP package.
  import ddp

  # Create a client, passing the URL of the server.
  client = ddp.ConcurrentDDPClient('ws://127.0.0.1:3000/websocket')

  # Once started, the client will maintain a connection to the server.
  client.start()

  # ... Do something with it ...

  # Ask the client to stop and wait for it to do so.
  client.stop()
  client.join()

  ```


__Call a method__

  Assume your Meteor server has the following method.

  ```JavaScript
  Meteor.methods({
    upper: function (text) {
      check(text, String);
      return text.toUpperCase();
    }
  });
  ```

  ```Python
  # The method is executed asynchronously.
  future = client.call('upper', 'Hello, World!')

  # ... Do something else ...

  # Block until the result message is received.
  result_message = future.get()

  # Check if an error occured else print the result.
  if result_message.has_error():
    print result_message.error
  else:
    print result_message.result

  ```

__Automatic reconnection__

If the connection to the server goes down, the client automatically attempts to
reconnect.


__Ponger__

Automatically responds to pings from the server.


__Outbox__

Call a method while the client was not connected? Do not fear, for pyddp's
outbox will store the message until there is a connection.


__Debugging__

  ```Python
  ddp.ConcurrentDDPClient(url, debug=True)
  ```


__Not implemented__

*   Automatic resend after reconnection
*   DDP server
*   Random seeds
*   Sensible reconnection delay (i.e. exponential back-off)
*   Subscriptions


## Installation

Install via `pip`

```Shell
$ pip install pyddp
```

## Documentation

### ddp.pubsub.future.Future

```Python
from ddp.pubsub.future import Future
future = Future()

# Wait for result forever (interruptable).
result = future.get()


# Wait for result for at most 1 second (interruptable).
from ddp.pubsub.timeout_error import TimeoutError

try:
    result = future.get(timeout=1)
except TimeoutError:
    print 'Took too long'
```
